# [OneMoreTry.app](https://www.OneMoreTry.app)

OneMoreTry is a tool for practicing anything.  It uses a **Delay Camera** that lets you try something and then see it play back right away.

OneMoreTry was built using Preact, Styled Components, and the MediaRecorder API.

## CLI Commands

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# test the production build locally
npm run serve

# run tests with jest and enzyme
npm run test
```
